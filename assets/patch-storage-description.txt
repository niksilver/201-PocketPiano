This is an alternative mother patch that adds six more synth slots without sacrificing any pattern slots.

The 201 Pocket Piano functions entirely as usual, and you still
have access to synth slots 1-6 in the normal way. However, you
can access additional slots 7-12 by holding down shift and
double tapping one of the synth buttons.
For example, if you hold shift and double tap synth button 1 (B below
middle C) you get synth 7. If you hold shift and double tap synth button 2
(middle C) you get synth 8. And so on.

Note that this is a variation of mother patch version 1.2.
